# Lua obfuscator
Lua obfuscator based on [lua simple encrypt](https://ganlvtech.github.io/lua-simple-encrypt/)

## Warning
I don't recommend using this obfuscator. It is really easy to crack with minimal Lua experience. Check out [psu obfuscator](https://discord.gg/psu) or [ironbrew-2](https://github.com/seavd/ironbrew-2), they are a lot better!
